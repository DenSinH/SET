# SET
A Python program for the game SET I made a while ago

I made this because me and a friend of mine were wondering if we should sign up for some course at the university. He did it, and could already see what the final assignment would be. This would be making a game of set, so I thought, I can do that now already. So I did, and I did not sign up for that course.

I do not own any of the rights to the original game SET
(don't know if I should mention that, better safe than sorry)
